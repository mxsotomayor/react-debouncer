# ⏲️ React Debouncer

A custom React hook for debouncing function execution, helping you optimize performance by limiting how often a function is called in response to rapid user actions.

## What is debouncing

Debouncing postpones a function’s execution until after a pause in activity, ensuring it runs only once after rapid, repeated calls stop.
